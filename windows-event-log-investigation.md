# Windows Event Log Investigation – Project 1

## Objective
To explore Windows Event Viewer and understand how Windows records system events.

## Tool Used
Windows Event Viewer

## Investigation Details
- Log: Windows Logs – System
- Level: Error
- Source: DistributedCOM
- Event ID: 10010

## Event Description
The server did not register with DCOM within the required timeout.

## Investigation
- Opened Windows Event Viewer.
- Navigated to Windows Logs → System.
- Identified a DistributedCOM error.
- Checked for other events with Event ID 10010.
- Found only one matching entry in the list checked.

## Initial Assessment
This event indicates a DCOM registration timeout. A single occurrence does not establish malicious activity.

## What I Learned
- How to access Windows Event Viewer.
- What Windows event logs are.
- How to identify an event's source, level and ID.
- Why security analysts investigate events before deciding whether they are suspicious.
